# Open Source CSO Datasets

__Purpose:__ Exploration of the open source datasets relating to crime, homelessness and deaths in Ireland

__Overview__

Initial exploration of the data to see if we can find anything interesting in the data. By working on this data we have the secondary goal of laying the foundations for colaberative work and to find out some of the potential sticking points, for example, setting up of a Slack channel.
